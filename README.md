## Hi there 👋

### QUIC! Let me introduce myself ! Pulling my data..

Hello ! I'm Julian, a full-stack DevOps engineer. What do I even by that? It's a term I made up. 😄

I'm interested in **everything** in the application engineering pipeline - circuit and firmware design, OS development, application / web development (backend/frontend),
networking, cloud, on-premise server management, devops, automation, testing, monitoring, multi-vendor negotiations - you name it !

While bulk of my professional career, including my current position, is in DevOps/SRE, I've had some experience in all my areas of interest, part through my educational background, and part as a hobbyist.

I believe that we should all work towards a world where everyone can follow their dreams and no one shackles chains on anyone.

Engineers have a strong power to contribute to that and I would like to take part in that grand mission so long as my soul inhabits my body.

I had this account since 2020 but almost never touched it. I've always had ideas, things I'd like to implement, build and work on but never got the chance to do so being held back by my personal weaknesses.
After an epiphany on the hard problem of consciousness and the value of all human life, I've decided to give it all and become the best version of me so I may touch and help out those in need.

_This is my prime drive for learning, and becoming a skilled programmer which made me start and maintain my github seriously this year of 2025._ 

- 🔭 Please look at my work in Github and give me feedback !!
- 👯 Please ask me to collaborate in your projects. The worse I could say is no. 
I'm sure I will at least be super interested, but due to familial responsibilities I may reject having a key part.
- 💬 Ask me about anything in life ! I may not be the wisest out there, but I have my own personal opinions on everything.
- ⚡ Other things I like: Spicy Foods, Weight Training, Calisthenics, Bouldering
