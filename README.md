## Hi there 👋

### QUIC! Let me introduce myself ! Pulling my data..

Hello ! I'm Julian — a full-stack DevOps engineer. What do I mean by that? Well… it’s a term I made up. 😄

I’m passionate about **every part** of the application engineering pipeline — from circuit and firmware design to OS development, web and application development (both backend and frontend), networking, cloud infrastructure, on-prem server management, DevOps, automation, testing, monitoring, even multi-vendor negotiations — you name it!

While most of my professional experience (including my current role) lies in DevOps and SRE, I’ve had exposure to all these fields — partly through my education, and partly as a lifelong hobbyist.

I believe we should all work toward a world where everyone can pursue their dreams freely — where no one places chains on anyone else.
Engineers hold great power to help make that world a reality, and I want to contribute to that mission for as long as I live.

I’ve had this GitHub account since 2020, but barely touched it for a long time.
I’ve always had ideas I wanted to build and share, but personal weaknesses held me back.

After an epiphany about consciousness and the intrinsic value of every human life, I decided to give my all — to become the best version of myself and use my skills to help others.

_That realization is what drives me to learn, grow, and maintain this GitHub seriously since 2025._ 

- 🔭 Check out my projects here on GitHub — I’d love your feedback!
- 👯 Feel free to invite me to collaborate on your projects! The worst I can say is no — and even then, I’ll probably be very interested. (I just might have to decline due to family responsibilities.)
- 💬 Ask me anything — tech, life, philosophy, anything. I’m not the wisest person out there, but I always have an opinion.
- ⚡ Other things I love: Spicy food 🌶️, weight training 🏋️, calisthenics 🤸, bouldering 🧗, rpg games 🎮.
